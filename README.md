## Visualisation

<p>The data set has alot of variable to get Visualisation for all variable it will take alot of time I will just try to get a story form this data set with some of dash boards each dash board will cover a varaible and realtion ship with some other </p>

<p> the link for the  initial visualisation is <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wessam.alhallak#!/vizhome/Loan_15539772362130/LoanCount?publish=yes">Initital Visualisation </a> </p>

### Design:

<p>Using Bubble set for market share with color variable to increase the importance of each category (factor) when there is many unique value in the factor</p>
<p>Using dynamic view for some time changing variables to let the viewer feel the changing in it 
(by  using page feature in Tableau)
</p>
<p>Using a parallel bar diagram for some categories ( few unique value like Term only 3 (12,36,60) )to make the comparison in each value of the factor more direct for perception  </p>
<p>Using pie diagram to show the market share for IncomeRange and the change in time</p>
<p>
Using Scatter plot to show the relation between to measure : and also using color to make it clear of the deference between terms
</p>

</p>

## Feedback: 
<p>1-Make the borrower rate  as a size variable to make it clear that when the value and turst of the borrower is high make the rate low : in the second dashboard of the story</p>
<p>2- All the dashboards and workspaces which are already included in story should be hidden ( dont repeat yourself) .</p>
<p>3- Adjust the color for the diagrams to make it color blind friendly</p>
<p>4- give a small discerption for the element of the story and make it easy to understand and self-digest.</p>
